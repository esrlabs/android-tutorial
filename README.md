# Android & Gradle - a hands-on introduction
 
This workshop (hopefully) teaches you everything you need to know to create your next Android applications with IntelliJ and Gradle. Even better, it will also show you how to write fast unit tests for your app. 

Please note, this is not an Android tutorial. It covers only the absolute basics of developing an Android application. Instead it concentrates on setting up everything so that you can focus on what is really important: building a great app. Actually, Andrei and I shaved a whole herd of yaks so that you don't have to.*

The tutorial is still going to be fun as you will learn everything while developing a simple game for your Android phone. The tutorial is split into four sessions, where each session covers a different topic:   

* [Session 1: Gradle](session1/README.md)
* [Session 2: IntelliJ & Android](session2/README.md)
* [Session 3: Java & JUnit](session3/README.md)
* [Session 4: Android & Robolectric](session4/README.md)

## Why Android Studio (IntelliJ)?

Android Studio is based on IntelliJ IDEA - the best Java IDE. Enough said.

## Why Gradle?

If you are really wondering why you should use Gradle instead of Ant for building your Android application, then you have never used Ant. In this case, be happy and just use Gradle. Otherwise you wouldn't ask.
